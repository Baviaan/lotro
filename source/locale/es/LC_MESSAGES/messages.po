"You can quickly schedule a raid with the `/rem` and `/ad` commands. "
"Examples:\n"
"`/rem t2 Friday 8pm`\n"
"`/ad t3 26 July 1pm`\n"
"Use `/custom` to schedule a custom raid or meetup.\n"
"\n"
"With `/calendar` you can get an (automatically updated) overview of all "
"scheduled raids. It is recommended you use a separate discord channel to "
"display the calendar in.\n"
"Use `/time_zones` to change the default time settings and you can designate "
"a raid leader role with `/leader`, which allows non-admins to edit raids."
