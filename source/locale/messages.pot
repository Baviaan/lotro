"`/rem t2 Friday 8pm`\n"
"`/ad t3 26 July 1pm`\n"
"Use `/custom` to schedule a custom raid or meetup.\n"

"With `/calendar` you can get an (automatically updated) overview of all scheduled raids. It is recommended you use a separate discord channel to display the calendar in.\n"
"Use `/time_zones` to change the default time settings and you can designate a raid leader role with `/leader`, which allows non-admins to edit raids."
